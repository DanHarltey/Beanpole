# Beanpole
Beanpole for simple control over AWS Elastic Beanstalks

This was developed to help testing using AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a live like environment. It allows testers to restart and alter web configs to enable testing but prevent alterations that allow it to differ from live too much. 

This was developed over 3 hackathons. The code reflects this. This is hackathon grade code, and therefore not indicative of my normal style or standard. This tool has been useful and so sharing it.

Uses: MVC5, MongoDB, SignalR client & server, AWS API
Keywords: Amazon, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Testing, Configuration override
